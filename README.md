# Building-Models-to-Predict-The-Prospective-Customer-using-pyspark

This repository consists of the Jupyter notebook providing usage of Pyspark machine learning framework, 
and feature selection and engineering as the following:

1. Data wrangling (Remove necessary columns and add new columns using UDF functions).
2. Feature Selections (Using data visualisation (correlation plot)).
3. Data Transformation (One-Hot Encoder, Vector representation transformation, and String Indexer).
4. Create a machine learning pipeline starting from data transformation, training the model and predicting the result
   (The models that will be used are decision tree and gradient boosting treefor the  classification task).
5. Plot the result as an AUC curve.
6. Knowledge check regarding cluster analysis.
